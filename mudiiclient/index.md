# What is this?

Mudiiclient is a MUD client specifically tailored to MUD2. It's super robust, blazingly fast, and has a streamlined interface that's entirely driven by the keyboard.

# Installation

(Sorry, these instructions are rather technical)

1. Ensure you have [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) installed. (In a command window and enter `java -version`).
2. Download [mudiiclient.jar](mudiiclient.jar).

# Starting mudiiclient

In a command window and enter `java -jar mudiiclient.jar`.
