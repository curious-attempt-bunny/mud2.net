# What is this?

Mudiiclient is a MUD client specifically tailored to MUD2. Havoc has been maintaining this client since 2000. So it's super robust and blazingly fast, with an interface that's entirely driven by the keyboard, and streamlined for super productive resets.

# Installation

(Sorry, these instructions are rather technical)

1. Ensure you have [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) installed. (In a command window and enter `java -version`).
2. Download [mudiiclient.jar](mudiiclient.jar).

# Starting mudiiclient

In a command window and enter `java -jar mudiiclient.jar`.

# Usage

The first thing you'll see is a login screen:
