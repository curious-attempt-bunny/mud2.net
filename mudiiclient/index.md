# What is this?

Mudiiclient is a MUD client specifically tailored to MUD2. It's super robust, blazingly fast, and has a streamlined interface that's entirely driven by the keyboard.

# Installation

1. Ensure you have [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) installed.
2. Download [mudiiclient.jar](mudiiclient.jar).
3. Locate your mudiiclient.jar on your computer and move it to it's own directory. That will keep log files and settings all in one place.

# Starting mudiiclient

Double click mudiiclient.jar to start it. If that doesn't work, then sorry, this gets a bit technical. You can try these steps:

1. Open a command window (e.g. [Windows](https://www.google.com/search?q=how%20to%20open%20a%20command%20prompt%20in%20windows), [Mac](https://www.google.com/search?q=how%20to%20open%20a%20command%20prompt%20on%20mac)).
2. Navigate to the directory you placed mudiiclient.jar (e.g. [Windows](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=how%20to%20change%20directories%20in%20command%20prompt%20windows), [Mac](https://www.google.com/search?q=how%20to%20change%20directories%20in%20terminal%20mac).
3. Enter the command `java -jar mudiiclient.jar`. If this says something like "java: command not found" you may not have Java installed.

# Usage

The first thing you'll see is a login screen:
