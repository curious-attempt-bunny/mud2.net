# What is this?

Mudiiclient is a MUD client specifically tailored to MUD2. It's super robust, blazingly fast, and has a streamlined interface that's entirely driven by the keyboard.

# Installation

Download the installer, and run it:

* [Windows installer](mudiiclient_windows_1_6_4.exe) 43Mb (includes Java).
* [Mac OSX installer](mudiiclient_macos_1_6_4.dmg) 74Mb (includes Java).
* [Linux installer](mudiiclient_unix_1_6_4.sh) 2Mb (does not include Java - you need to install Oracle Java 1.6+ yourself).

# Usage

The first thing you'll see is a login screen:
