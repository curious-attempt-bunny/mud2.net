## Planning when to play

Need a convenient way to invite others to the start of a particular reset? Look no further! In the calendar below, click a reset, and then select "copy to my calendar" (watch out: if someone triggers a mortal reset, you'll need to copy it again - so be sure to check back here closer to the time). This calendar is shown using London time. Don't live in London? Click the "+" button in the bottom right of the calendar to add it to your google calendar. Don't see any resets in the calendar? Complain to Havoc on the mudii forum. Enjoy!
